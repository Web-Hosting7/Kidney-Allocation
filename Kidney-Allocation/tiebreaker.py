"""
Multi-step tie-breaker for ambiguous FFT predictions  (Priority 9 — prototype).
SURA 2026 · IIT Delhi

WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE MODULE
-----------------------------
This is an accuracy *investigation*, not a committed change to the model. It is
therefore built so that it can be switched on and off without touching the
model itself:

  * `fft_model.FastFrugalTree._row_predict` is NOT modified. The tree predicts
    exactly as it always did.
  * Nothing here runs unless `enabled()` returns True.
  * The only integration point is `predict_with_tiebreak()`, which callers opt
    into explicitly. When disabled it returns the plain tree prediction
    unchanged, so removing the feature is a one-line revert.

WHAT IT DOES
------------
When the tree reaches a decision by a hair — the deciding cue only barely
cleared its threshold, or nothing fired at all and the default leaf is close to
a coin flip — the call is treated as ambiguous. A short ordered chain of 2–3
extra cues (the "right-side" tie-breaker) is then consulted. The first cue in
the chain that separates the two patients decisively enough decides the case;
if none does, the tree's original answer stands.

Enable with the environment variable:

    FFT_TIEBREAKER=1            # off unless set to 1/true/yes/on
    FFT_TIEBREAKER_STEPS=3      # chain length, clamped to 2..3
